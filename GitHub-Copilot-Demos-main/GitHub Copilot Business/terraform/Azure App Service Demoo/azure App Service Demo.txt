Terraform - VSCode
    This demo is used to showcase GitHub Copilot chat, and it's context awareness in the workspace.
    We'll use @workspace to show the workspace context function.

    *** NOTE THAT THIS ASSUMES YOU HAVE INSERTED MODULES INTO THE "modules" FOLDER.
    THE CURRENT FILES IN THE FOLDER ARE MEANT TO REPRESENT A COMPANIES MODULES.
    If you can't find Terraform modules for the company on their GitHub, consider changing the name of the folders
    and the README.md file to your customer name, instead of placeholder ***

    Keep the main.tf file open throughout the demo.
	Demo:
        1. Start with asking the following prompts in the GitHub Copilot chat:
	PROMPT: How can I create a windows web app in Azure with terraform?
	PROMPT: @workspace Do we have existing modules for creating a windows web app in Azure with terraform?
	PROMPT: @workspace How do I use that module?
        2. After getting the code we insert it into the main.tf file, and follow up with test generation:
	PROMPT: are there any ways to test terraform code?
	PROMPT: can you write a test with terratest for the current file?
        3. Showcase that the Copilot created the tests.
