Kotlin (Daniel) - IntelliJ
	This Kotlin function is a simple calculator which can add, subtract, divide and multiply.
	Here is how a demo transcript may look.
    Demo:
	    1. Showcase the calculator class.
        2. Open the GitHub Copilot chat and ask the following prompt:
	PROMPT: /tests create 2 tests for each function
        3. Insert the code that the chat responds with, and follow up with the following prompt:
	PROMPT:  can you add 3 more tests for the divide function?
        4. Show the answer and insert this code as well. 
        In some cases it might write the entire class and not just the tests, in that case paste it over the existing class.
        5. Now we can follow up with some edge case testing by using the following prompt:
	PROMPT: are there any cases that are not tested for the divide function?
	    6. Add this to the class as you did in step 4.
        7. Finally you may ask the GitHub Copilot chat if all test cases are covered.
	PROMPT: how about now, are we fully covered?
        8. Show the answer.
