app.py
	This Python file is made to demonstrate inline comments from GHCfB. 
	This is an example of the demo transcript.
	Demo:
		1. Show the code and give an introduction to the user and task classes.
		2. Explain we're adding new endpoints for CRUD operations on the tasks belonging to a user.
		3. Go to the Todo comments, press enter and GitHub Copilot should come up with a suggestion.
		4. Showcase that the comments work in Norwegian as well, if that seems relevant.
		5. Use the GitHub Copilot chat with the "/explain" command to explain the PUT method.
		6. Lastly you can showcase that the copilot also works without comments.
		This can be done by creating new users where the "alternatively add more users" is written.
