C# - VSCode 
	This project is taken from (https://github.com/gh-msft-innersource/CopilotPlayground/tree/main/FollowStandards)
	It's meant to demonstrate that GitHub Copilot follows coding standards in a project.
    By following the steps marked with an * the project can also be used to show IDE pull request generation and commit message generation.
    The project is best showcased in Visual Studio or VSCode.

	Demo:
    * If also showcasing Git functionality, make sure to have created a new branch where you write the changes.
    1. Open StoreProxy.cs and explain that we're gonna write the GetOrder method.
	2. Add a comment to the GetOrder method "// handle the response"
    3. Showcase the suggestions GitHub Copilot makes, which are pretty simple.
	4. Explain a bit about the GitHub Copilot's context, especially regarding open windows.
	5. Open up PetProxy.cs
	6. Delete the code you got from step 2 and rewrite the "// handle the response" comment.
	7. Show that the suggestions made now takes the coding standards set in PetProxy into context.
	*8. Commit the change, use GitHub Copilot to generate the commit message.
	9. Talk about handling of negative id's in the getorder method.
    10. Showcase TestStoreProxy and it's existing tests for negative id.
    11. Open up the StoreProxy file and write "// Handle negative id" at the top of the method.
    *12. Commit the generated code and make GitHub copilot generate the commit message.
	*13. Open a Pull Request and have GitHub copilot generate a summary of the changes made.
